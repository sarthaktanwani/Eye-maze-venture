# Maze-Eye-Venture

This project introduces a method of EOG signal processing using a state machine requiring a low memory and processing footprint. The processed signals from the EOG waveform are interfaced with Unity to play the game "Maze Eye-venture". The game is a demonstration of using bio-signals to perform general-purpose tasks on a computer without the need for standard inputs such as a keyboard and a mouse. The gameplay is in real-time and only requires the user's eye movements to play the entire game.
